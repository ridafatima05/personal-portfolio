              Hello! I&apos;m Rida Fatima, a passionate Frontend
              Developer, Graphic Designer, and a dedicated student of the
              Governor IT Initiative GenAI Metaverse program. With a strong
              foundation in web development and UI/UX design, I craft visually
              engaging, user-friendly websites and applications that deliver
              exceptional experiences. My skills span from designing intuitive
              interfaces to implementing responsive, dynamic front-end solutions
              using modern technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and React.
              As a graphic designer, I also have a keen eye for aesthetics,
              creating striking visuals and brand identities that resonate with
              audiences. Currently, I&apos;m advancing my knowledge in cutting-edge
              technologies as part of the GenAI Metaverse program, where I&apos;m
              exploring the intersection of AI, immersive experiences, and the
              metaverse to build the future of digital interaction. Driven by
              curiosity and creativity, I am always looking for new challenges
              and opportunities to expand my skill set and collaborate with
              like-minded individuals.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-6">
              I am always open to learning new technologies and improving my
              skills. I love working on innovative projects and collaborating
              with like-minded people.
